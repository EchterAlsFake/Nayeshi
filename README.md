# Announcement

I decided to change this program a little bit. I just hate cheaters which are using Aimbots, ESP and other stuff, and I decided
to troll those idiots a little bit. So I reformed this project to be a fake Aimbot, but it actually is ransomware. You can help me
trolling some cheaters and make some kids cry. You'll find a folder for a GUI and a CLI. The GUI looks more professional, but has more size.
The CLI / GUI will trick the user and make them think that the program is currently trying to generate pointers for player detection. It Doesn't make any sense, 
but they should think it's doing something. The Ransomware is set to the default path of C:\Users\ 

I know that this is not the greatest idea, but I am just sick of it.
If people ask you for cheats, send them the exe and txt file and hope they never contact you again.

There's also a .torrent file and a magnet link as I am trying to spread the Aimbot over p2p, because people trust p2p stuff more.
